# Squeezing-of-drops-through-constrictions
Some of the code used for the Master thesis "Transit time and clogging of drops in constrictions".

The scripts, which are found in the folder scripts, are written in Python and use packages such as numpy, mshr and dolfin. The scripts are written for Python 3.6.8 and dolfin version 2019.1.0.

The .txt files are the extracted profile of capillary 1, mentioned in the thesis, and three different extraced drop profiles.
